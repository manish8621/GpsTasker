location based trigger

We have to set trigger (what should happen when mobile reaches a target

location)

Examples

1.can put mobile into silent mode when we reach office

2.can ring the mobile when we reach a location (while travelling)

3.can send Message like "hey i reached the place" to someone,so we dont forget notifying them
